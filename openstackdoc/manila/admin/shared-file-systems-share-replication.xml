        <title>Share replication</title>
        <paragraph>Replication of data has a number of use cases in the cloud. One use case is
            High Availability of the data in a shared file system, used for example, to
            support a production database. Another use case is ensuring Data Protection;
            i.e being prepared for a disaster by having a replication location that will be
            ready to back up your primary data source.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Shared File System service supports user facing APIs that allow users to
            create shares that support replication, add and remove share replicas and
            manage their snapshots and access rules. Three replication types are currently
            supported and they vary in the semantics associated with the primary share and
            the secondary copies.</paragraph>
        <important>
            <paragraph><strong>Share replication</strong> is an <strong>experimental</strong> Shared File Systems API in
                the Mitaka release. Contributors can change or remove the experimental
                part of the Shared File Systems API in further releases without maintaining
                backward compatibility. Experimental APIs have an
                <literal>X-OpenStack-Manila-API-Experimental: true</literal> header in their HTTP requests.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>The <title_reference>status</title_reference> attribute of the non-active replica being promoted will be
                set to <literal>replication_change</literal> during its promotion. This has been classified as
                a <literal>busy</literal> state and thus API interactions with the share are restricted

            <paragraph>The following examples have been implemented with the ZFSonLinux driver that
                is a reference implementation in the Shared File Systems service. It operates
                in <literal>driver_handles_share_servers=False</literal> mode and supports the <literal>readable</literal>
                type of replication. In the example, we assume a configuration of two
                Availability Zones (configuration option: <literal>storage_availability_zone</literal>),
                called <title_reference>availability_zone_1</title_reference> and <title_reference>availability_zone_2</title_reference>.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Multiple availability zones are not necessary to use the replication feature.
                However, the use of an availability zone as a <literal>failure domain</literal> is encouraged.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Pay attention to the network configuration for the ZFS driver. Here, we assume
                a configuration of <literal>zfs_service_ip</literal> and <literal>zfs_share_export_ip</literal> from two
                separate networks. The service network is reachable from the host where the
                <literal>manila-share</literal> service is running. The share export IP is from a network that
