        <title>Share Replication</title>
        <paragraph>As of the Mitaka release of OpenStack, <reference internal="True" refuri="../reference/glossary#term-manila"><inline classes="xref std std-term">manila</inline></reference> supports replication of
            shares between different pools for drivers that operate with
            <literal>driver_handles_share_servers=False</literal> mode. These pools may be on different
            backends or within the same backend. This feature can be used as a disaster
            recovery solution or as a load sharing mirroring solution depending upon the
            replication style chosen, the capability of the driver and the configuration
            of backends.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>This feature assumes and relies on the fact that share drivers will be
            responsible for communicating with ALL storage controllers necessary to
            achieve any replication tasks, even if that involves sending commands to
            other storage controllers in other Availability Zones (or AZs).</paragraph>
        <paragraph>End users would be able to create and manage their replicas, alongside their
            shares and snapshots.</paragraph>

            <title>Storage availability zones and replication domains</title>
            <paragraph>Replication is supported within the same availability zone, but in an ideal
                solution, an Availability Zone should be perceived as a single failure domain.
                So this feature provides the most value in an inter-AZ replication use case.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The <literal>replication_domain</literal> option is a backend specific StrOpt option to be
                used within <literal>manila.conf</literal>. The value can be any ASCII string. Two backends
                that can replicate between each other would have the same
                <literal>replication_domain</literal>. This comes from the premise that manila expects
                Share Replication to be performed between backends that have similar
                characteristics.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>When scheduling new replicas, the scheduler takes into account the
                <literal>replication_domain</literal> option to match similar backends. It also ensures that
                only one replica can be scheduled per pool. When backends report multiple
                pools, manila would allow for replication between two pools on the same
                backend.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The <literal>replication_domain</literal> option is meant to be used in conjunction with the
                <literal>storage_availability_zone</literal> option to utilize this solution for Data
                Protection/Disaster Recovery.</paragraph>

                not make sense since all replicas are <reference internal="True" refuri="../reference/glossary#term-active"><inline classes="xref std std-term">active</inline></reference> (or writable) at all
                given points of time.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The <literal>status</literal> attribute of the non-active replica being promoted will be set
                to <reference internal="True" refuri="../reference/glossary#term-replication-change"><inline classes="xref std std-term">replication_change</inline></reference> during its promotion. This has been classified
                as a <literal>busy</literal> state and hence API interactions with the share are restricted
                while one of its replicas is in this state.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Promotion of replicas with <reference internal="True" refuri="../reference/glossary#term-replica-state"><inline classes="xref std std-term">replica_state</inline></reference> set to <literal>error</literal> may not be
                fully supported by the backend. However, manila allows the action as an
                administrator feature and such an attempt may be honored by backends if
                possible.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>When multiple replicas exist, multiple replication relationships
                between shares may need to be redefined at the backend during the promotion
                operation. If the driver fails at this stage, the replicas may be left in an
                inconsistent state. The share manager will set all replicas to have the
                <literal>status</literal> attribute set to <literal>error</literal>. Recovery from this state would require
                administrator intervention.</paragraph>
        </section>
        <section ids="snapshots" names="snapshots">
            <title>Snapshots</title>
            <paragraph>If the driver supports snapshots, the replication of a snapshot is expected
                to be initiated simultaneously with the creation of the snapshot on the
                <reference internal="True" refuri="../reference/glossary#term-active"><inline classes="xref std std-term">active</inline></reference> replica. Manila tracks snapshots across replicas as separate
                snapshot instances. The aggregate snapshot object itself will be in
                <literal>creating</literal> state until it is <literal>available</literal> across all of the share’s replicas
                that have their <reference internal="True" refuri="../reference/glossary#term-replica-state"><inline classes="xref std std-term">replica_state</inline></reference> attribute set to <reference internal="True" refuri="../reference/glossary#term-active"><inline classes="xref std std-term">active</inline></reference> or
                <literal>in_sync</literal>.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Therefore, for a driver that supports snapshots, the definition of being
                <literal>in_sync</literal> with the primary is not only that data is ensured (within the
                <reference internal="True" refuri="../reference/glossary#term-recovery-point-objective"><inline classes="xref std std-term">recovery point objective</inline></reference>), but also that any ‘available’ snapshots
                on the primary are ensured on the replica as well. If the snapshots cannot
                be ensured, the <reference internal="True" refuri="../reference/glossary#term-replica-state"><inline classes="xref std std-term">replica_state</inline></reference> <emphasis>must</emphasis> be reported to manila as being
                <literal>out_of_sync</literal> until the snapshots have been replicated.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>When a snapshot instance has its <literal>status</literal> attribute set to <literal>creating</literal> or
                <literal>deleting</literal>, manila will poll the respective drivers for a status update. As
                described earlier, the parent snapshot itself will be <literal>available</literal> only when
                its instances across the <reference internal="True" refuri="../reference/glossary#term-active"><inline classes="xref std std-term">active</inline></reference> and <literal>in_sync</literal> replicas of the share
                are <literal>available</literal>. The polling interval will be the same as

            <paragraph>Access rules are not meant to be different across the replicas of the share.
                Manila expects drivers to handle these access rules effectively depending on
                the style of replication supported. For example, the <reference internal="True" refuri="../reference/glossary#term-dr"><inline classes="xref std std-term">dr</inline></reference> style of
                replication does mean that the non-active replicas are inaccessible, so if
                read-write rules are expected, then the rules should be applied on the
                <reference internal="True" refuri="../reference/glossary#term-active"><inline classes="xref std std-term">active</inline></reference> replica only. Similarly, drivers that
                support <reference internal="True" refuri="../reference/glossary#term-readable"><inline classes="xref std std-term">readable</inline></reference> replication type should apply any read-write
                rules as read-only for the non-active replicas.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Drivers will receive all the access rules in <literal>create_replica</literal>,
                <literal>delete_replica</literal> and <literal>update_replica_state</literal> calls and have ample
                opportunity to reconcile these rules effectively across replicas.</paragraph>

                                                This includes snapshot instances of every snapshot of the share
                                                whose ‘aggregate_status’ property was reported to be ‘available’
                                                when the share manager initiated this request. Each list member
                                                will have two sub dictionaries: ‘active_replica_snapshot’ and
                                                ‘share_replica_snapshot’. The ‘active’ replica snapshot corresponds
                                                to the instance of the snapshot on any of the ‘active’ replicas of
                                                the share while share_replica_snapshot corresponds to the snapshot
                                                instance for the specific replica being updated. The driver needs
                                                to ensure that this snapshot instance is truly available before
                                                transitioning from ‘out_of_sync’ to ‘in_sync’. Snapshots instances
