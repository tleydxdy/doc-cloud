            <title>Configuring DevStack for Horizon</title>
            <paragraph>Place the following content into <literal>devstack/local.conf</literal> to start the services
                that Horizon supports in DevStack when <literal>stack.sh</literal> is run. If you need to use
                this with a stable branch you need to add <literal>stable/&lt;branch name&gt;</literal> to the end
                of each <literal>enable_plugin</literal> line (e.g. <literal>stable/mitaka</literal>). You can also check
                out DevStack using a stable branch tag. For more information on DevStack,
                see <reference refuri="https://docs.openstack.org/devstack/latest/">https://docs.openstack.org/devstack/latest/</reference></paragraph>

# Recloning will ensure that your stack is up to date. The downside
# is overhead on restarts and potentially losing a stable environment.
# If set to `yes`, will reclone all repos every time stack.sh is run.
# The default is `no`.
#
# RECLONE=yes

# By default `stack.sh` will only install Python packages if no version is
# currently installed, or the current version does not match a specified
# requirement. If `PIP_UPGRADE` is set to `True` then existing required
# Python packages will be upgraded to the most recent version that matches
# requirements. This is generally recommended, as most of OpenStack is
# tested on latest packages, rather than older versions. The default is
# False.
#
# PIP_UPGRADE=TRUE

# Set `OFFLINE` to `True` to configure `stack.sh` to run cleanly without
# Internet access. `stack.sh` must have been previously run with Internet
# access to install prerequisites and fetch repositories.
#
# OFFLINE=True

# Note: there are several network setting changes that may be
# required to get networking properly configured in your environment.
# This file is just using the defaults set up by devstack.
# For a more detailed treatment of devstack network configuration
# options, please see:
# https://docs.openstack.org/devstack/latest/guides.html

# Horizon is enabled by default in Devstack, but since we're developing
# it's advised to use a separate clone. To disable horizon in DevStack,
# speeding up stack time, use:
#
# disable_service horizon

### Supported Services

# and currently supported by the Horizon maintainers

SWIFT_REPLICAS=1
SWIFT_DATA_DIR=$DEST/data/swift

# Enable Heat
